# Generated with Veil and Shellter

This folder contains payloads generated using the tools **Veil** and **Shellter**, which are commonly utilized for creating evasive payloads designed to bypass antivirus (AV) detection. These files demonstrate the use of advanced techniques to increase stealth and reduce detection rates by AV and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems.

---

## Included Files

1. **PayloadShellter.exe**
   - A payload generated using the Shellter tool, which integrates advanced polymorphic shellcode injection techniques.
   - **Purpose**: Demonstrates the ability of Shellter to transform executables into stealthy payloads that evade AV detection.

2. **PayloadVeil.exe**
   - A payload created with Veil, a tool that utilizes obfuscation and encryption techniques to bypass security mechanisms.
   - **Purpose**: Highlights the effectiveness of Veil in producing executable files that are challenging for AV systems to detect.

## Purpose

The payloads in this directory serve to:

- Test the evasion capabilities of executables produced by **Veil** and **Shellter**.
- Demonstrate the use of **polymorphic shellcode injection** and **obfuscation techniques** in bypassing AV detection.
- Provide a comparison of the effectiveness of these tools against modern detection mechanisms.

## Tools Used

1. **Veil**:
   - An open-source tool designed for generating payloads that evade antivirus software by employing obfuscation and encryption techniques.
   - **Website**: [Veil Framework](https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil)

2. **Shellter**:
   - A runtime shellcode injection tool that dynamically modifies the behavior of executables to include custom payloads while retaining their original functionality.
   - **Website**: [Shellter](https://www.shellterproject.com/)

## How to Use

1. **Testing**:
   - Upload the payloads to an antivirus scanning service such as VirusTotal to evaluate detection rates.
   - Analyze the results to understand the effectiveness of the employed techniques.

2. **Execution**:
   - These payloads are ready to be executed in controlled, isolated environments for research purposes.
   - Ensure that all usage complies with ethical guidelines and is conducted in authorized environments.

3. **Customization**:
   - Generate your own payloads using Veil or Shellter by referring to their documentation.
   - Experiment with different configurations to test their impact on AV evasion.
