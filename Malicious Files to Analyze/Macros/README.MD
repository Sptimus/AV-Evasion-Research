# Macros

This directory contains scripts and examples of macros commonly used in penetration testing and research into antivirus evasion strategies. The macros are designed to simulate real-world scenarios involving document-based attacks and to explore how security systems respond to such methods.

## Purpose

Macros in this folder are created to:
- **Test antivirus evasion:** Evaluate how different antivirus solutions detect and handle malicious macros.
- **Analyze security mechanisms:** Understand how macros interact with operating systems and security software during execution.
- **Demonstrate persistence techniques:** Showcase how macros can be used to maintain access to systems by embedding malicious logic into document files.

## Contents

- **VBA Scripts:** Visual Basic for Applications macros designed to execute payloads or alter system settings.
- **Malicious Document Examples:** Pre-configured document files embedding the macros for testing purposes.
- **Documentation:** Details on the behavior, structure, and use of each macro.


## `WordAdvancedRunner.vbs`

This script serves as a foundational runner designed to load and execute shellcode within the `WINWORD.exe` process. It features detection and patching mechanisms for AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. Additionally, it contains embedded shellcode for both architectures, dynamically determining the target system's architecture before execution.

The script employs a `sleep` function to detect and evade antivirus sandbox environments. Optionally, it can validate that the target system resides within the `192.168.0.0/16` IP range, although this functionality is commented out by default and can be activated by the user.

The shellcode in this script is presented in a non-obfuscated form, leaving obfuscation as an exercise for the user. Further obfuscation techniques could enhance stealth, but these are omitted here to maintain the scriptâ€™s readability and educational value.

## `WordBasicRunner.vbs`

A simplified version of `WordAdvancedRunner.vbs` that removes advanced features such as AMSI bypass and IP range validation. It is intended for scenarios where minimal functionality is sufficient or as an introduction to the core concepts.
