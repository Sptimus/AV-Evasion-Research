# Persistence

This folder contains files and scripts designed to demonstrate various **persistence techniques** used in cybersecurity research, particularly from a red team perspective. These examples showcase methods attackers might use to maintain access to a compromised system even after reboots or user logouts.

## Included Content:
1. **Registry-based Persistence**: Modifying system registry keys to launch applications on startup.
2. **Scheduled Tasks**: Using task scheduling to automate the execution of programs.
3. **Service Creation**: Leveraging the Service Control Manager (SCM) to create persistent services.
4. **Fileless Persistence**: Techniques to maintain persistence without writing files to disk.

## Purpose:
- Educate about system persistence mechanisms.
- Analyze and test defensive measures against persistence strategies.

## Disclaimer:
This content is for **educational and research purposes only**. Use these files in isolated and controlled environments. Unauthorized use of these techniques is strictly prohibited and may lead to severe legal consequences.
