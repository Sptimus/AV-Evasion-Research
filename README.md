## Usage

1. **Antivirus Evasion**:
   - Test provided scripts to explore various bypass techniques.
   - Customize payloads to assess antivirus detection mechanisms.

2. **System Persistence**:
   - Experiment with persistence methods, including registry keys, task scheduling, and fileless techniques.
   - Observe how these methods interact with modern operating systems and defenses.

3. **Testing**:
   - Use tools like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) for detection analysis.
   - Always test in isolated, secure environments.

## Key Concepts

### Antivirus Detection Evasion
1. **Signature-Based Detection**: Evade static signatures by altering payloads.
2. **Heuristic-Based Detection**: Use obfuscation or encoded payloads to bypass behavioral checks.
3. **Behavior-Based Detection**: Execute payloads in a manner that mimics legitimate processes.

### System Persistence
1. **Registry Keys**: Automatically execute malicious programs during system startup.
2. **Scheduled Tasks**: Persist across reboots with task triggers like logins or system restarts.
3. **Services**: Create malicious services for long-term persistence.
4. **Fileless Techniques**: Execute directly in memory to avoid leaving disk artifacts.

## Motivation and Purpose

The motivation for this repository stems from the need to:
- Understand the capabilities and limitations of antivirus software.
- Develop practical knowledge of red team methodologies.
- Bridge the gap between offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies.

The repository's findings and examples aim to contribute to the field of cybersecurity by supporting better detection mechanisms and more effective defense strategies.
